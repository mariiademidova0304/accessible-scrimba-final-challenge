# Reflection
1. I found pixels-rem and contrasting colors to be the most difficult to implement. It's hard to visualize rem and then you have to calculate. While contrasting colors put some constraints on design.
2. ARIA allows users relying on assistive technologies to get the information which otherwise wouldn't have been accessible to them, like description of images. It also reduces the repetitive content and assures visibility.
3. WebAim, but in this instance I just searched up the best placeholder text color in google.
